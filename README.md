- **CDC Social Vulnerability Index/SVI (2018)**: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html  
- **JHU covid data (curren)**: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

- **NCSL unemployment data**: https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-unemployment-update.aspx  
The CDC data provided us with demographic information such as poverty rates, incomes, and minority rates.

Mobility and unemployment data both provided us relevant information during the pandamic. All datasets are analyzed on state-level and had been geographically categorized into **Midwest**, **Northeast**, **South**, and **West** based on convention/Wikipedia.
